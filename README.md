This project showcases an interactive Power BI dashboard designed to help users track and manage their income, expenses, and savings more effectively. The goal was to consolidate financial data into a single, user-friendly platform that supports better budgeting and spending decisions.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview --> I developed this dashboard to provide a clear visual overview of personal financial health. The dataset was taken from Youtube Channel Codebasics - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqSoCa2NGj4&t=4587s. This dashboard is aimed to capture a complete picture of income streams, expense categories, and savings trends.

Key Questions
1. What is my spending and saving behaviour?
2. Do I have spend according to what I earn?
3. What is the breakdown of my income, expenses and savings?
   
ðŸ›  Tools & Techniques Used

1. Power BI: Dashboard creation and data visualization.
2. Power Query (ETL Tool): To clean, filter and structure raw data for analysis.
3. DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) â€“ To calculate key metrics such as:
   1. Total Income
   2. Total Expenses
   3. Net Savings

   2. Established relationships between tables for dynamic filtering.
3. Dashboard Design
   1. Created a range of visualizations, including
      1. Bar charts for category-wise expenses.
